# Introduction
This is the code implementation for Spectra classification. We use machine learning methods to predict whether an unseen sample contains a particular or several species. The code includes various machine learning methods including Neural Networks, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors and more. Our experiment results are reported in * [Experiment results](#Textdetection).

# Data
